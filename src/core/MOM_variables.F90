!   This subroutine writes out chksums for the model's basic state variables.
! Arguments: mesg - A message that appears on the chksum lines.
!  (in)      u - Zonal velocity, in m s-1.
!  (in)      v - Meridional velocity, in m s-1.
!  (in)      h - Layer thickness, in m.
!  (in)      uh - Volume flux through zonal faces = u*h*dy, m3 s-1.
!  (in)      vh - Volume flux through meridional faces = v*h*dx, in m3 s-1.
!  (in)      G - The ocean's grid structure.
  integer :: is, ie, js, je, nz
  is = G%isc ; ie = G%iec ; js = G%jsc ; je = G%jec ; nz = G%ke

  ! Note that for the chksum calls to be useful for reproducing across PE
  ! counts, there must be no redundant points, so all variables use is..ie
  ! and js...je as their extent.
